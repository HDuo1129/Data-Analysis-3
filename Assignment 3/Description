# DA3 Assignment 3  
**Finding Fast Growing Firms 2025**  
*Individual or in pairs*

---

## The Assignment

Your task is to build a model to predict fast growth of firms using the bisnode-firms data we used in class.

- **Target Definition:**  
  You should design the target (fast growth); it can be measured in any way you like over one (e.g. 2013 vs 2012) or two years (e.g. 2014 vs 2012).  
  You need to argue for your choice, discussing a few alternatives (maybe 2–3 paragraphs) using concepts and ideas from corporate finance.

- **Model Building:**  
  Build three different models and pick the one you like the most.  
  **Models should include at least one logit and one random forest.**

- **Data Management and Sample Design:**  
  - The dataset is very close to what you saw in the seminar.  
  - You need to start with the panel for 2010–2015.  
  - Two pieces of code are provided for sample design and prediction:  
    - `ch17-firm-exit-data-prep`  
      Starts from `cs_bisnode_panel.csv` and yields `bisnode_firms_clean.csv`  
    - `ch17-predicting-firm-exit`  
      On the sample, you can make changes, but it is not mandatory.
  - **Features:**  
    You may use similar variables and features we used for exit prediction, or you may choose differently.  
    Look at descriptives, lowess, tabulate factors, and make decisions accordingly.

## Tasks

### **Task 1: Probability Prediction**

1. **Part I: Probability Prediction**  
   - Predict probabilities using your models.  
   - Look at cross-validated performance and pick your favorite model.

2. **Part II: Classification**  
   - Think about the business problem, and define your loss function (e.g., FP = X dollars, FN = Y dollars).  
   - For each model:  
     - Predict probabilities.  
     - Look for the optimal classification threshold.  
     - Calculate expected loss with your loss function.  
   - Pick the model that has the smallest average (over 5 folds) expected loss.

3. **Part III: Discussion of Results**  
   - Show a confusion table (on a selected fold or holdout set).  
   - Discuss results and evaluate how useful your model may be.

### **Task 2: Industry Specific Analysis**

- There are two industry categories in the dataset: **manufacturing** and **services** (repair, accommodation, food).  
- Define a single loss function, but carry out the exercise for the two groups separately.
  - Pick a prediction model, carry out classification for manufacturing and then repeat for services.
  - Compare the model performance across the two samples.

## Submission Requirements

You must submit **two documents** to Moodle:

1. **Summary Report (PDF)**  
   - Maximum 5 pages including tables and graphs.  
   - The report should be targeted to data science team leaders and senior managers.  
   - You can use technical language but explain briefly and concisely.  
   - Focus on key decision points, results, interpretation, and final decision.
   - Include links to your code in GitHub.

2. **Technical Report**  
   - A markdown/notebook (exported to PDF/HTML) with a more detailed technical discussion.  
   - May include code snippets (not verbose; avoid iterations, etc.), additional tables, and graphs.  
   - Detail all the decisions you made.

## AI Policy

- **You may use AI for coding, code refactoring, and documentation.**
- **You may use AI for language editing and formatting.**
- **You shall not use AI for other parts of the project.**
- **You must check everything, as you are responsible for all submitted work.**

## Hints for Using Git

- **Create a Folder for Each Assignment:**  
  Keep your work organized by creating a separate folder for each assignment.

- **Version Control with Git:**  
  Git helps you experiment with your code and maintain a clean, reproducible repository.  
  At the end, ensure your repo is well-organized so the reader can see which parts you intend to deliver.

- **Branching:**  
  While branching is an option, it is recommended to use a single branch to keep the workflow simple.

- **A Well-Organized Repo:**  
  A meaningful and well-organized git repository is also an important component of your resume.  
  Your well-formatted and well-documented assignments will serve as an introduction to who you are and what you have learned.
